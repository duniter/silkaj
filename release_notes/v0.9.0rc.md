## Call for testing Silkaj v0.9.0rc

Hello everyone!

We are pleased to publish a release candidate of Silkaj v0.9.0, and we would be happy to receive feedback before releasing it as a stable version.

To install this pre-release version from PyPI, use this command:
```sh
pip3 install silkaj --user --upgrade --pre
```
Please test it globally, and check [the changelog](https://git.duniter.org/clients/python/silkaj/-/blob/0.9/CHANGELOG.md) which contains the changes which happen during this development cycle.
Pay a special attention to the transaction part where a part of the algorithm changed.
There are new options on following commands:
```sh
silkaj history --full-pubkey
silkaj --dry-run cert
silkaj --dry-run/--display membership
```
Dry-run and display options are defined as general options, and only defined for this three cases for this release.

### Tests

Manual testing helps us make sure averything works fine on different setups.
Here are some tests we think necessary.
Make sure you test on GTest network to avoid losing any money.

## TX

* send a TX to a unique receiver
* send a TX to many receivers
  * with one amount
  * with many amounts
* send a TX to 92 receivers (can be 92 times the same)
* send a TX to 93 receivers (should fail)

## Membership

* renew membership with --dry-run global option
* renew membership with --display global option
* renew membership

## cert

* send a cert with --display global option
* cert all identities you can on GTest network (thanks for keeping it alive ;-) )
* cert pubkey 4KEA63RCFF7AXUePPg5Q7JX9RtzXjywai1iKmE7LcoEC:DRz on GTest -> you should be proposed two identities
* cert identity ggg_ggg_2 on GTest -> you should NOT be proposed many identities

## history

* check you history
* check you history and display userIDs
* check you history and display pubkeys in full-length
* check you history and display userIDs and pubkeys in full-length
